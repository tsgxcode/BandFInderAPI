#Band Finder Disc Cogs API ... A Code:You project!

Welcome to The Bandfinder ...

-This project has been rewritten a couple of times in some form.
its was orinaly going to ba a Hot Wheels database of sorts making requests to a HotWheel API, 
not one does not exist and I was out of time to create one. So I went with onother love, Music!


What it does:
  • Search for bands listed on Disc Cogs website
   
   Knowen issues: only response currently is "Band not found", but it
   is making the call to the Disc Cogs API...

 How to run it:
   • Clone to your machine.
   • Go to https://www.discogs.com/ You'll need a free acount and then get an API key 
     and then put that key into code in the JS folder, once inside:
    
   You look for this line >>> const discogsApiKey = 'YOUR_DISCOGS_API_KEY'; // Replace with your API key 


How it written, what tools:
   • Some of the JS code was from my knowledge with lots of help from Gemini AI, As I've not wroked with Java Script for awhile. 
    all the HTML and CSS is mine but its the basics. 
 
 What is the goal:
   • To make add database fuctionality for saving the found data from Disc Cogs
    and probably make a table on the home page.

More info to follow :)
