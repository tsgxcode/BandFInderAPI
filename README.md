Description
  Creat an app. that can help Diecast collectors calalog their collections 


First phase:

 Part 1.
   Initial goals for this project:

     • Creat a clean, yet detailed visual client side app via HTML and CSS

     • Input fields for brand, vehicle name, date of issue and a larger field to 
       give some details about the vehicle such as color, wheel type and 
       any factory oddities about the vehicle.

     • Then save to a basic text files.

   Deeper goal:

     • Develop an executable application for desktop 



Note: I might also develop an app for Android. I woulde consider an Iphon, but an Iphone app 
 would requir buying a Mac, so this would be a distant future.
